Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group have staged several world tours.]',\n",

Wings became BTS\\' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \"Mic Drop\".

BTS are ranked #4 of Billboard\\'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. Billboard ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list.

In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s-90s and excessively fierce visuals.[21] From their inception, BTS was convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music.[22] The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future.[21] During the production of the album, Suga and RM rewrote the lyrics of “No More Dream” more than 20 times.[22] The single album\\'s release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows.[23][24] Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated BTS\\' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence.[23] Expanding their endeavors to Japan, \"No More Dream\" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014.[25]]',\n",

Lyrically, the EP expanded on the theme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves.[28] Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts.[29] That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV\\'s Rookie King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, \"Channel Bangtan\", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.[30] At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 5th Melon Music Awards, 28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards.[31]]',\n",

Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds of rock within the framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B. The central theme of the album\\'s lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for romance.[43] During production of the album, BTS recorded their single \"Danger\" in a makeshift studio in a garage in Los Angeles.[44] Following several appearances on Korean music shows,[45] BTS embarked on their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, from October to December, held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok.[46]]',\n",
